========================================================
IMPORTANT: UPDATE YOUR RENDER.COM DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS
========================================================

If you're still seeing only the basic placeholder page instead of your React app,
please update your Render.com settings manually:

1. Go to the Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select your solmegle web service
3. Click on "Settings" in the left sidebar
4. Scroll down to the "Build & Deploy" section

Update these settings:

BUILD COMMAND:
-------------
chmod +x render-build.sh && ./render-build.sh

START COMMAND:
-------------
node copy-react-build.js && node server/dist/index.js

5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Go back to the main dashboard
7. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Clear build cache & deploy"

This will force Render to use our custom build process that properly copies
the React files to the correct location.
