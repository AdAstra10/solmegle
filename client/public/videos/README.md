# Solmegle Video Fallbacks

This folder should contain 43 video files named from `1.mp4` to `43.mp4` that will be used as fallbacks when no real users are available for video chat.

## File Requirements

- Each file should be named with just a number (e.g., `1.mp4`, `2.mp4`, etc.)
- Files should be in MP4 format for maximum browser compatibility
- Video resolution should ideally be 640x480 or similar aspect ratio
- Videos should be relatively short (30 seconds to 2 minutes) to provide variety
- Avoid very large files to prevent performance issues

## Privacy & Legal Considerations

Ensure all videos:
- Are either created by you or properly licensed for this use
- Do not contain any inappropriate content
- Do not include identifiable individuals without their consent
- Follow all relevant privacy laws and regulations

## How the System Works

When a user connects to Solmegle and no real partners are available:
1. The system randomly selects one of these videos
2. The video plays in the stranger's video area
3. When the video ends, another random video is automatically selected
4. Each video has associated simulated chat messages that appear in the chat area

This creates the impression of an active platform with users even when real users are not currently available.

## Installation

Simply place your 43 video files in this directory, ensuring they follow the naming convention of `1.mp4` through `43.mp4`.
